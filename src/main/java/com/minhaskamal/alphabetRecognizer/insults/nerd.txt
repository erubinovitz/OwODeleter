So you're going by "Ara" now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Biopanda from Highschool. Remember me? Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in Hentai Fan Club. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Evan the guy you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I get over 200 trips to East a year and get swol 5 times a week with him. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic.

H-hey Ara, do you remember me from Hentai Fan Club? Big Dong Chong's Abode? It's Evan. I just wanted to stop by since you missed the last East run, I was looking for you. I always thought you were really smart and talented, but I could never work up the nerve to tell you. Anyway, I hope you're doing well...HAHA Just kidding, it's still Biopanda you fucking gullible idiot lmfao. Anyway, the gym awaits, see ya man good talk.
