Shut the fuck up you absolute lobotomite. You think adding your poorly edited Skyrim makes this funny? What a joke. Get a grip on reality, stop saying "oof" during a serious conversation just because your two braincells cant ever send signals to eachother to form a response. Honestly pathetic. Oh guys look at me Im so funny OOF 100! Its so funny and quirky because its a roblox noise right guys? Hahah skyrim reference!! Shut the fuck up you absolute fucking dusty toilet. I would flush you down the drain in an instant.
