What pisses me the fuck of about it is how fucking nonsensical the lyrics are, the guy is saying that he wants different characters and the girl is saying that she already is ALL the characters that the guy suggests, how in the everloving fuck does that make sense?? You can't be several characters at once! Or is the girl supposed to be different people every time she answers?? And another thing, when he suggests Bastion, she says that they should NERF Bastion which implies that he is an OP character, which would be a reason FOR picking Bastion, not the other way around. It's such fucking nonsense and it pisses me off
