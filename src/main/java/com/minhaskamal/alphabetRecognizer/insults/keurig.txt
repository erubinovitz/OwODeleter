you fool. you absolute baffoon. You think you can challenge me in my own realm?
you think you can rebel against my authority? you dare come into my house and
upturn my dining chairs and spill coffee grounds in my Keurig? you thought you were safe in your
chain mail armor behind that screen of yours. I will take these laminate wood floor boards
and destroy you. i didnt want war. but i didnt start it
