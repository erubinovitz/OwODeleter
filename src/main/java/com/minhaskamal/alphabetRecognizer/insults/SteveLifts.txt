Steve has 36 inventory slots. This means he can carry 36 shulker boxes, each of which itself has 27 item slots. Each one of these slots can contain 64 enchanted golden apples. An enchanted golden apples is made with 8 blocks of gold and one apple. Each in-game block is 1m3, weighing 42,550 lbs, and the average apple weights 1/3 of a pound. All told, Steve carries 36 shulker boxes loaded with a total of 62,208 enchanted golden apples. To make this staggering number of the gilded galas, you would need 497,664 blocks of gold. Using the earlier weight, this gives us 21,175,603,200 pounds of gold. BUT WE'RE NOT DONE THERE! Adding the weight of the apples themselves, we arrive at a whopping total of 21,175,623,936 fucking pounds. For comparison, the average person weighs 137 lbs, meaning Steve carries the equivalent of 154,566,598 people, just slightly more than the population of the entire fucking country of Russia.
