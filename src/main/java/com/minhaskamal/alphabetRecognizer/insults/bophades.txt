Have you ever heard of the story of the Greek hero Bophades? His story is similar to the story of Achilles. When he was a child his father held him by the groin and dipped him in the river Styx, as to make him invincible in battle. However, just as Achilles did, he had a weak spot. Because his father had held him by the groin, this was where he became vulnerable. In the case of Achilles, this was his heel, so you may have heard of an Achilles heel, or an Achilles' tendon, but I bet you never heard of Bophades nuts.
